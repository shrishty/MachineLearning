# Machine Learning - University of Washington

This is the coursera course I did to learn basics of machine learning. Overview of contents of this repo is mentioned below.

## Course 1: Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach
This course covered various use-cases which can be solved by machine learning. 
In this course I learnt how to use various ML APIs to solve machine learning problems

Few of them are listed below:
1. How is Machine Learning changing the world?
2. Basics of python, jupyter notebook and graphlab create
3. Using graphlab create for Linear Regression - Predicting house prices
4. Used classification algorithm to build intelligent resturant review system
5. Text retrieval - Retrieve articles which interest users using k-nearest neighbour algorithm
6. Song recommender system - Collaborative filtering
7. Image Retrieval - Deep Learning
